**Development on this has stopped. It's done the job for me and I am off Moq. It still works, but I'm not going to work on additional features or maintain dependabot going forward.**

<HR>
This is a relatively simple tool to convert Moq tests to NSubstitute. It is not perfect, but it does a reasonable job. It is not intended to be a perfect conversion, but to get you most of the way there.
